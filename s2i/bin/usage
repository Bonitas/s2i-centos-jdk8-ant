This is a CentOS S2I image with JDK8 and Apache Ant preinstalled ready to run on OpenShift.
For more information about Apache Ant: http://ant.apache.org/.

To compile your Ant-based applications, a file called 'build.xml' must exist in the root context directory.
If you want to use an alternative build.xml file, set the environment variable BUILDFILE.
The whole compilation should be invoked by the ant default task.
If otherwise, you want to invoke an alternative task, set its name to the environment variable BUILD_TASK.

To run your application, an ant task called 'run' must exist in your build file.
If you want to run an alternative task, set its name to the environment variable RUN_TASK.
Your application server must launch on port 8080.

It is assumed that the classes are built inside a directory called 'bin'. This directory
is cached across builds through the save-artifacts script.
If you have an alternative bin directory, set its name to the environment variable BIN_DIR.
